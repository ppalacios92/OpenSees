# Ladruno nonlinear RC shell stack — a header-only RC kernel on the ASDShellQ4 + LayeredShellFiberSection frontier

**What.** A fork-authored, header-only, OpenSees-free reinforced-concrete constitutive kernel
(`LadrunoRCKernel.h`) cloned from the proven `LadrunoJ2Kernel.h` "one core, many views" pattern,
consumed through thin `nDMaterial` views that ride the **existing** `ASDShellQ4` (tag 203) +
`LayeredShellFiberSection` seam with at most one adaptor. The kernel keeps `ASDConcrete3DMaterial`'s
verified-correct plastic-damage spine (spectral effective-stress split, dual `dt`/`dc` damage,
Lubliner–Lee–Fenves biaxial envelope, crack-band `lch` regularization, IMPL-EX, crack-closure) and
adds the four physics layers that production RC codes have and `ASDConcrete3D` lacks: compression
(transverse-tension) softening, a degrading aggregate-interlock shear-transfer law, tension
stiffening, and a consistent algorithmic tangent that honors the new strength couplings. An
optional `LadrunoSolidShell` host carries the through-thickness state for punching/bearing — the one
genuine *elemental* blind spot a director shell cannot represent.

**Why.** The deficiency that makes OpenSees over-predict squat-wall diagonal-strut capacity and
miss cyclic pinching is **constitutive, not elemental.** For a wall loaded in its plane the
structural shear `V` lives in the **membrane** block (`gxy`/`tau_xy`), so it is governed by the
plane-stress constitutive law, not by transverse shear and not by element technology. `ASDShellQ4`
(AGQ6-I membrane + 4-DOF EAS + MITC4 transverse shear + Hughes–Brezzi drilling + optional
corotational) already equals the LS-DYNA `ELFORM=16` fully-integrated assumed-strain shell, and
`LayeredShellFiberSection` already does the standard director-stack integration. Rebuilding either
re-treads solved element technology for zero new physics. The **keystone seam decision** is therefore:
keep the element and section at the frontier, deliver the missing physics as a material that drops
into the **5-component `PlateFiber`** layer view the section already requests, and reserve the
finite-strain / `sigma_33`-carrying path for a separate solid-shell host. This document also folds in
the hard findings the adversarial review surfaced — several "free reuse" claims do not survive
contact with the source and are re-scoped below rather than buried.

## Background theory — the mechanics

### Generalized shell strain and the director-stack split

The shell elements compute an 8-component generalized strain

```
E = [ e_xx  e_yy  g_xy | k_xx  k_yy  k_xy | g_xz  g_yz ]
      \___ membrane ___/  \___ bending ___/  \_ shear _/
```

and call `Section::setTrialSectionDeformation(E)` (verified `ASDShellQ4.cpp:2009`). The section
integrates through the thickness. `LayeredShellFiberSection` places one midpoint per layer at
`sg[i] = (2i+1)/n − 1`, `wg[i] = 2*t_i/h`, and at signed distance `z_i = 0.5*h*sg[i]` forms the
per-layer plane state `e(z) = e_m − z*kappa`, handing each layer a **5-component `PlateFiber` strain**
`[e_xx e_yy g_xy g_yz g_xz]` (verified `LayeredShellFiberSection.cpp:420-452`). Resultants are
`N = sum w_i sigma_i`, `M = sum w_i z_i sigma_i`, `V = sum w_i tau_i`; the 8×8 tangent is the
transposed assembly `A_sig^T (dd_5x5) A_eps` (`getSectionTangent`, lines 508-670). The constructor
hard-codes `fibers[i]->getCopy("PlateFiber")` and `exit(-1)`s if it returns null
(`LayeredShellFiberSection.cpp:175-180`) — a load-bearing constraint, below.

### Plane-stress condensation (`sigma_33 = 0`)

A 3D law enters a shell layer by condensing `sigma_33 = 0` via a nested scalar Newton on
`eps_33`: `PlateFiberMaterial.cpp:213-258` iterates `Tstrain22 -= condensedStress/dd22` with
`dd22 = threeDtangent(2,2)`, capped at `maxCount = 20`, tolerance `1e-8`. **Critical caveat**
(de Souza Neto §9.4): for a *plastic-damage* law `dd22 -> (1−d)E -> 0` on the softening branch,
so the bare `1/dd22` step explodes or sign-flips, and the loop **returns 0 even when unconverged**.
This is a genuine hazard, addressed in the Decision (the RC `PlateFiber` view must guard and report
non-convergence, not inherit the silent `return 0`).

### MCFT / FSAM compression softening

The verified gap: `ASDConcrete3D`'s `equivalentCompressiveStrainMeasure` uses only the negative
*effective-stress* principals; there is **no** reduction of compressive strength by transverse
tensile cracking strain. The Modified Compression Field Theory (Vecchio & Collins 1986) closes this
with a softening factor on the compressive **strength**:

```
fc_eff = beta * fc' ,    beta = 1 / (0.8 + 170 * eps_1) <= 1 ,    d(beta)/d(eps_1) = -170 * beta^2
```

where `eps_1` is the average principal **tensile** (cracking) strain transverse to the strut. The
DSFM variant (Vecchio 2000) uses `beta = 1/(1 + Cs*Cd)`, `Cd = 0.35*(-eps_1/eps_2 − 0.28)^0.8`.

> **Insertion-point correctness (folded-in fatal finding, D4).** `beta` must scale the **strength /
> stress axis** (`fc'`, equivalently the effective-compressive backbone value `q` fed into `dc`, or a
> contraction of the Lubliner activation surface to `beta*fc'`). It must **not** scale the *strain
> abscissa* fed to `equivalentCompressiveStrainMeasure()`. The abscissa is built from effective-stress
> principals and indexes a non-linear backbone (`ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp` ~2403, 2512-2522); scaling
> it merely slides the lookup point along a fixed curve, so the realized peak is `hc(beta*xc)` — an
> uncontrolled value that equals `beta*fc'` only for a linear-through-origin backbone, which concrete
> is not. The acceptance test is a closed-form check: hold confined compression, sweep `eps_1`, assert
> realized peak `|sigma_c| = beta(eps_1)*fc'`.

> **Double-counting against the existing biaxial envelope (folded-in high finding, D4).** The Lubliner
> envelope (`fb = 1.16 fc`, `Kc`, `gamma = 3(1−Kc)/(2Kc−1)`, verified `ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp`
> ~2483-2497) already raises the effective-stress measure in the tension–compression quadrant where
> struts live. Stacking `beta` on top double-penalizes that quadrant and can flip the verified
> *over*-prediction into *under*-prediction. With `beta` active, the tension–compression `k1`/`gamma`
> interaction must be reduced or disabled so transverse tension is counted once; `beta` and `Kc` must
> be calibrated **jointly** against a tension–compression panel battery (Kupfer points + Vecchio–Collins).

**OpenSees already ships MCFT prior art** (verified present): `SRC/material/nD/reinforcedConcretePlaneStress/`
(`RAReinforcedConcretePlaneStress` rotating-angle, `FAReinforcedConcretePlaneStress` fixed-angle,
`ConcreteL01/Z01`, `SteelZ01`), `ConcreteMcftNonLinear5/7`, and the `FSAM` material. The gap is
specific to `ASDConcrete3D`, *not* to OpenSees as a whole. These materials are therefore validation
oracles and a "what physics to include" reference, not code to ignore (see Prior art, below).

### Shear retention, rotating vs fixed crack, and the objectivity boundary

> **The shear-retention / crack-model coupling (folded-in high finding, D4/D5).** A pure
> **rotating-crack** model is coaxial — stress and strain share eigenvectors, so there is **no
> independent crack-plane shear stiffness**; cracked shear is fully determined by the principal normal
> stiffnesses (this is exactly why `ASDConcrete3D`'s cracked shear is an emergent spectral byproduct).
> The moment you impose an independent retention `beta_sr * G` on a **stored crack normal `n`**, you
> have re-introduced a fixed crack frame whose response is orientation-history dependent and **fails a
> rigid-rotation objectivity test** — the FSAM/fixed-crack problem the rotating choice was meant to
> avoid. You cannot have both "rotating and coaxial" and "independent `beta_sr*G` on a stored normal."

This forces a clean choice. Cyclic **pinching** physically arises from slip and aggregate-interlock
degradation on a **formed (fixed) crack** across load reversals — a rotating-coaxial model
structurally cannot accumulate it. Since cyclic squat-wall pinching is an explicit goal, the v1
default cannot be plain rotating MCFT. The Decision adopts **fixed-crack-with-degrading-interlock
(FSAM-style) / DSFM (rotating + slip)** as the cyclic core, accepting that the stored crack frame is
a directional internal variable subject to the dSNPO §14.11 large-rotation objectivity boundary
(below), and uses the **corotational element frame** as the supported large-rotation route.

The interlock magnitude can be bounded by the MCFT crack-shear limit
`v_ci,max = 0.18*sqrt(fc') / (0.31 + 24w/(a_g+16))`, crack width `w = eps_1 * s_theta`, with crack
spacing `s_theta` from `lch` or reinforcement spacing.

### Tension stiffening

Between cracks, bonded reinforcement carries average tensile stress, raising the *average* concrete
tension above bare fracture-energy softening:

```
sigma_t_avg = ft / (1 + sqrt(c * eps_1))           (MCFT / Bentz)
sigma_t_avg = alpha1*alpha2*ft / (1 + sqrt(500*eps_1))   (Collins–Mitchell)
```

> **MCFT requires composite `eps_1` (folded-in high finding, D5).** MCFT softening and tension
> stiffening are defined on the **reinforced** average principal tensile strain. If smeared web steel
> lives *outside* the kernel as a separate section layer, the concrete kernel computes `beta` from a
> bare-concrete `eps_1` (no tension stiffening) and over-softens, while the steel layer carries
> tension independently — the two never share the MCFT compatibility equation. Therefore the kernel
> **homogenizes smeared web steel** (or at least receives the rebar strain) for the membrane core;
> external `PlateRebar(LadrunoRebarBuckling)` layers are reserved for **discrete boundary-element
> bars** where buckling matters, not the smeared web that controls strut softening.

### Consistent algorithmic tangent (incl. d(beta)/d(eps_1) and the projector derivative)

The continuum damage-coupled tangent is `D = (I − D_dmg) C0 − sigma~ (x) dD/deps`. The
`sigma~ (x) dD/deps` term is precisely the strength-coupling the secant drops. With `beta = beta(eps_1)`:

```
D_alg = (I − dt_bar PT − dc_bar PC) C0
        − sigma~^- (x) (d dc/d beta)(d beta/d eps_1)(d eps_1/d eps)
        − sigma~^+ (x) (d dt/d eps_eq)(d eps_eq/d eps)
        − (shear/interlock cross term)
        + (dP/deps : sigma~)              [eigenprojector-rotation term]
```

with `d beta/d eps_1 = -170 beta^2` and `d eps_1/d eps = p_1 (x) p_1`.

> **Re-derive against the ACTUAL update, not the secant (folded-in high finding, D4).**
> `ASDConcrete3D`'s operative tangent (`ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp:2462-2469`) already uses the
> **nominal** `dt_bar`/`dc_bar` with **fixed** projectors and is itself only an approximate secant —
> it omits `d dt_bar/d eps`, the plastic-strain derivative, the `R`/`mix_dam` coupling
> `d dc/d dt`, and `dP/deps`. The RC tangent must be derived against the real update sequence, not
> bolted onto the misquoted secant, or it still will not be quadratically convergent.

> **Eigenprojector degeneracy (folded-in high finding, D4).** `dP_i/deps ∝ (p_i (x) p_j + p_j (x) p_i)/(lambda_i − lambda_j)`
> is **singular** at equibiaxial / hydrostatic states (`lambda_i -> lambda_j`), which walls (corners)
> and slabs (biaxial bending) visit routinely. Use the Miehe (1993) / de Souza Neto §A
> perturbation–limit regularization with a coalescence tolerance (blend to the symmetric average when
> `|lambda_i − lambda_j| < tol`); a v1 fallback is to keep the **fixed-projector secant** for the
> `dP` term and add only the scalar `beta`/`beta_sr` cross-terms — a defensible, explicitly-stated
> choice rather than an open footnote.

### Crack-band regularization and direction

Bazant–Oh: scale the softening modulus so dissipated energy `g_f = G_f / lch_band` is
mesh-objective. The correct `lch` is the element size **projected onto the crack normal**.

> **`lch` is delivered out-of-band as a single in-plane scalar (folded-in high finding, D2/D3/D4/D5).**
> Verified: the only `lch` channel is `lch = ops_TheActiveElement->getCharacteristicLength()`
> (`ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp:1614-1618`), latched **once** (`if (!regularization_done)`), applying the
> **same scalar to tension and compression**; `ASDShellQ4::getCharacteristicLength()`
> (`ASDShellQ4.cpp:1858-1868`) returns the **min nodal distance** (not `sqrt(A)`), **halved when EAS is
> active**, and `setParameter` has **no `lch` case**. There is no per-direction, per-layer, or
> per-crack-normal `lch` channel and an `nDMaterial` cannot override an *element* method. Consequences
> (all real): (a) "directional lch rides the unchanged seam" is **false**; (b) `lch = sqrt(A)` computed
> in the section diverges from the element's EAS-aware value; (c) a single getCharacteristicLength scalar
> mis-regularizes inclined (~45°) wall struts by up to sqrt(2); (d) through-thickness crush-band width is
> not deliverable on this seam. The Decision resolves this explicitly rather than assuming it away.

### Objectivity via the corotational element frame

For pure rigid motion `x_a = Q X_a + c`, the EICR/solid polar fit gives `R = Q`, so deformational
`u_d = R^T(x_a−x_c) − (X_a−X_c) = 0` and the material sees zero strain — frame-indifference holds for
the de-rotated path. The trifecta review established the corotational **element** path is objective
for kinematic hardening because `u_d` is in the reference frame, whereas the `setTrialF` log-strain
**material** wrapper is not (dSNPO §14.11). For RC:

> **Scalar damage is frame-indifferent; the crack frame is not (folded-in high finding, D1/D5).** The
> `dt`/`dc` scalars are objective, but spectral projectors, a stored crack normal, and a directional
> interlock state are directional internal variables that inherit the §14.11 boundary under large
> rotation. The corotational **element** frame (`ASDShellQ4 -corotational`, `LadrunoBrick -geom corot`)
> is the supported objective route for moderate-to-large wall rotation. The `LadrunoRCFiniteStrain`
> (`setTrialF`) view is **objective only for the isotropic-damage spine**; its fixed-crack/interlock
> directional state under large rotation is pinned **xfail** until a co-rotating-crack finite-native
> view exists.

> **Single solid corotation is not a shell corotation (folded-in high finding, D1).** For a thin
> solid-shell (`t << L`), `SolidTransformationCorot` extracts **one** element-average `R` from a polar
> fit of the nodal cloud `H = sum (x_a−x_c)(X_a−X_c)^T`; the eigenvalue ratio of `S=(H^T H)^{1/2}`
> scales as `(L/t)^2`, so the bending rotation is ill-conditioned and a single `R` cannot remove the
> through-thickness-varying bending rotation that is the dominant shell strain. The solid corot is only
> reliable in moderate-rotation / thicker regimes; thin large-rotation cases route to `-geom finite` or
> a shell-aware corotation, with a `cond(S)` guard in `update()`.

### LS-DYNA comparison (manual citations and portable lessons)

LS-DYNA independently arrived at the **"thin element, thick material"** division this ADR adopts. The
portable lessons (Theory Manual, R-versions; sections verified against the Theory Manual, per-`MAT`
Vol II page numbers **flagged unverified** below):

- **Belytschko–Lin–Tsay `ELFORM=2`** (Theory §7): one-point co-rotational Mindlin shell with viscous
  perturbation **hourglass control** (shape vector `tau_I`, eq 7.15; hourglass stress rates eq
  7.18a-c scaled by `r in [0.01,0.05]`). Resultant integration `f^R = ∫ sigma dz`, `m^R = −∫ z sigma dz`
  (eqs 7.13a/b) is **identical** to `LayeredShellFiberSection`. Lesson: any reduced-integration shell
  host must degrade hourglass stiffness with damage — exactly the `LadrunoBrick`
  `Kstab <- max(1%, 1−max(dt,dc))` pattern.
- **Hughes–Liu `ELFORM=1`** (Theory §10): degenerated-brick director shell; lamina frame enforces
  `sigma_33 = 0` (§10.2.2), Hughes–Carnoy iterative thickness-thinning (eqs 10.37-10.39). This is the
  director shell the panel explicitly declines to re-tread.
- **Fully-integrated `ELFORM=16`** (Theory §9): Hu–Washizu three-field, Pian–Sumihara assumed in-plane
  strain (anti-locking), Bathe–Dvorkin MITC transverse shear (§9.4), Belytschko–Leviathan drill
  projection (eq 9.27). **Direct analog of `ASDShellQ4`** (AGQ6-I/EAS + MITC4 + drilling) — confirming
  `ASDShellQ4` is already at the LS-DYNA frontier.
- **Layered-shell transverse shear** (Theory §11): FOSDT gives a constant `gamma_xz` that violates
  zero-traction faces and "could yield very stiff behavior in sandwich and laminated shells"; LS-DYNA
  reconstructs a parabolic `tau_xz` from `d tau_xz/dz = −d sigma_x/dx` (eqs 11.10-11.14). **Portable
  lesson with a sharp caveat (folded-in finding, D6):** this is a **1D-bending postprocessor** needing
  an in-plane *stress gradient* the per-Gauss-point material API does not own. It is valid as an
  **output recovery** (`setResponse('tauxz_profile')`), **not** as a tangent-bearing constitutive law;
  it cannot ride the existing seam "with one adaptor." v1 transverse shear is a **local degrading shear
  law**, not the gradient-coupled equilibrium profile.
- **Concrete cards.** MAT_084/085 Winfrith (smeared crack, explicit cracked-plane **shear-retention**
  factor), MAT_172 Concrete_EC2 (layered RC shell, explicit tension stiffening + EC2 compression
  curve), MAT_159 CSCM (cap + damage), MAT_072R3 K&C (three-surface, eta-interpolated residual =
  degrading shear), MAT_273 CDPM2 (two damage variables — directly comparable to `ASDConcrete3D`'s
  `dt`/`dc`). **Verdict:** every production RC card carries an explicit degrading-shear and/or
  compression-softening term that `ASDConcrete3D` lacks — independent confirmation that the four missing
  layers are exactly what a "great" RC material needs.

> **Honesty on LS-DYNA framing (folded-in finding, D6).** LS-DYNA corroborates the *architectural
> division* (prior art for "thin element, thick material"); it does **not** "prove the kernel correct."
> Kernel correctness is established only by the experiment + oracle battery. The Vol II per-`MAT` page
> numbers (MAT_159 ~p.1139, MAT_172 ~p.1208, MAT_072R3 ~p.582, MAT_273 ~p.1890) are carried from the
> brief and **must be spot-checked against the on-disk R15/R16 PDFs**, or cited by `MAT` number +
> manual version only, before appearing as durable citations.

## Decision — the architecture across six dimensions

**D1 — Hosts.** Two hosts, one seam. (a) **Reuse `ASDShellQ4` (203) unmodified** as the primary RC
shell host for walls and slabs; reuse `ASDShellT3` (204) and `ShellNLDKGQ` (157) as-is. (b) **Build
`LadrunoSolidShell` (classTag 33020)** — 8-node, 3 translational DOF/node, full 3D state carrying
`sigma_33`, with mandatory EAS-on-`E33` + ANS/MITC transverse shear + ANS membrane/trapezoidal cures —
as a **narrow specialist for punching/bearing/3D-stress and large strain**, not a co-equal flexural
host. *Rejected:* a new director shell (duplicates `ASDShellQ4`/Felippa AFEM Ch.31-36 for zero physics);
a 6-DOF drilling solid-shell (defeats brick/contact parity, cannot use `SolidTransformationCorot`);
bolting `sigma_33` onto `ASDShellQ4` (corrupts the proven Reissner–Mindlin element); full-integration
solid-shell (locks catastrophically — Belytschko Ch.8).

> Re-scoped from the proposal: (1) **`LadrunoBrick`'s "EAS" is NOT a reusable template.** It is the
> SSPbrick stabilized-single-point scheme that condenses enhanced modes **once at setup with the initial
> elastic tangent** into a **constant** `Kstab` (`LadrunoBrick.h:270-281`). Genuine EAS-on-`E33` for
> softening RC needs **persistent committed `alpha[nEAS]`, per-Newton condensation with the consistent
> *damaged* tangent**, and serialized send/recvSelf — net-new Simo–Rifai code, not a port. A constant
> `Kstab` would leave the thickness mode elastically stiff exactly where the element must soften.
> (2) The single-layer solid-shell has ~2 z-Gauss points; it cannot resolve cracked-RC `sigma(z)` or the
> migrating neutral axis, so it ships with **selectable multi-layer / Gauss–Lobatto `n_z`** and is
> benchmarked vs `LayeredShellFiberSection` before any flexural claim. (3) `ASDShellQ4`(6-DOF) ↔
> solid-shell(3-DOF) edges lose moment continuity; a documented, **validated** rigid-link/`equalDOF`
> connection recipe is a D1 deliverable.

**D2 — Deformation seam.** The **8-component generalized-strain → `Section::setTrialSectionDeformation`
→ per-layer 5-component `PlateFiber`** path is the default and only mandatory seam. **Do not route `F`
through the section** (the Section has no Gauss-point `F`, no current geometry, and cannot assemble the
element-owned geometric stiffness — first-principles Belytschko split, corroborated by
`LayeredShellFiberSection.cpp:420-504` only ever seeing the 8-vec and assembling an 8×8). The `F`-seam
(`FiniteStrainNDMaterial::setTrialF`, `LogStrainNDMaterial`) is a **separate optional host** for the
solid-shell and `LadrunoBrick -geom finite`. *Rejected:* section-chooses-reduce-vs-passthrough; pass-`F`
everywhere (pays the eigen-log spatial-tangent cost on every layer for zero in-plane-shear gain, inherits
§14.11); the generic `PlateFiberMaterial` wrapper (redundant condensation on top of the kernel's own).
**Verified:** `FiniteStrainNDMaterial.h` and `LogStrainNDMaterial.{h,cpp}` are present on this branch —
the solid-shell `F`-view is reuse, not a dependency on unshipped assets.

**D3 — Section.** Use `LayeredShellFiberSection` essentially as-is via the `PlateFiber` view (below);
keep **midpoint-per-layer** integration as the default with **8–12 layers** for nonlinear RC bending
(warn below 6); offer per-layer `-quad lobatto2` only for homogeneous/elastic layers. The section seam
stays **strictly order-5 `PlateFiber`** — any `PlaneStress` order-3 view lives **inside** the RC material,
never at the section boundary, and never via `PlateFromPlaneStress`'s elastic-`gmod` transverse shear.

> Re-scoped from the proposal (D3): (1) **A subclass that does not override `getCopy()` is SLICED to
> the base type.** `LayeredShellFiberSection::getCopy()` hard-constructs `new LayeredShellFiberSection(...)`
> and `ASDShellQ4.cpp:740` clones per-Gauss-point — a subclass overriding "only ~3 methods" silently runs

> instead of inherit. **v1 avoids this entirely:** the RC `PlateFiber` view drops into the *unmodified*
> `LayeredShellFiberSection`; no fork section is needed for Phase 1. (2) **Smeared rebar must not be a
> rho-weighted overlay at a concrete layer's `z_i`** (double-counts concrete `(1)c + rho*s` instead of
> `(1−rho)c + rho*s`); discrete boundary rebar is its own thin layer at the true bar depth with the
> overlapping concrete reduced. (3) `setResponse('damage')` on a shell section is a **recorder/diagnostic**
> output, **not** a `Kstab` coupling — `ASDShellQ4` has no damage-scalable hourglass stiffness analogous
> to `LadrunoBrick`. (4) `lch_t = t_i` is **not** a safe compression default — it triggers snapback and the
> material's `gmin` clamp silently discards it; floor it at a physical crush-band width.

**D4 — RC kernel physics.** Author `LadrunoRCKernel.h` keeping the `ASDConcrete3D` spine verbatim and
adding: compression softening `beta = 1/(0.8+170*eps_1)` **applied to the strength/stress axis** (with the
Lubliner tension–compression interaction reduced to avoid double-counting); a **fixed-crack /
DSFM-with-slip** degrading aggregate-interlock shear law (chosen over plain rotating-coaxial **because
cyclic pinching needs a fixed plane**); opt-in tension stiffening (default = fracture-energy, so flags-off
reduces to baseline); the **full consistent tangent** re-derived against the real update with a
**regularized eigenprojector derivative** (or fixed-projector-secant v1 fallback); IMPL-EX with
**clamped extrapolated `eps_1` and `beta in [floor,1]`**; and crack-band regularization fed by the `lch`
resolution chosen in D5. *Rejected:* secant-only tangent (drops the real `beta` Jacobian → squat-wall
divergence); editing `ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp` (answers only `ThreeDimensional`, forfeits the
multi-view + ledger story); replicating MAT_172/MAT_159 verbatim (closed, knob-heavy).

**D5 — Software architecture.** Header-only OpenSees-free `LadrunoRCKernel.h` (namespace
`ladruno_rc_kernel`), numpy-oracle-testable before any OpenSees link, cloning `LadrunoJ2Kernel.h`.
**Views and classTags:**

| Class | classTag | `getType()` | order | host / status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LadrunoRCPlateFiber` | 33014 | `PlateFiber` | 5 | **the shell path** — rides `LayeredShellFiberSection` `getCopy("PlateFiber")` |
| `LadrunoRCPlaneStress` | 33013 | `PlaneStress` | 3 | 2D continuum / membrane quad **only**; oracle exerciser — **NOT a shell host** |
| `LadrunoRCFiniteStrain` | 33015 | `ThreeDimensional` | — | optional solid-shell / `-geom finite`; xfail under large-rotation directional state |

> Re-scoped from the proposal (D5): (1) **`ASDShellQ4` consumes a `SectionForceDeformation`, not an
> `nDMaterial`** (`ASDShellQ4.h:128`, `.cpp:740`). The "`PlaneStress` drops directly into `ASDShellQ4`"
> claim is false — the **shell path is the `PlateFiber` view only.** `PlaneStress` (33013) hosts a 2D
> continuum element and is the clean oracle target; it is shipped for that, not as a wall solution. (2)
> **"Byte-identical across all three views" is downgraded.** A native plane-stress map and a 3D map of a
> *directional* (crack-normal-bearing) law do not commute with `sigma_33=0` condensation or large-rotation
> log-strain. The accurate guarantee: `returnMapPS` is byte-shared between the `PlaneStress` view and the
> `PlateFiber` in-plane block; the FiniteStrain view uses a **distinct 3D map** validated independently.
> Identity-gate regressions are **per-view reduce-to-`ASDConcrete3D`**, not cross-view. (3) **`getCopy(type)`
> self-routing mints sibling classTags** — centralize history pack/unpack in a shared header so all

**D5 — `lch` resolution (the binding cross-cut).** Pick and own **one**:
- **Option A (v1 default, recommended):** accept the element's **scalar in-plane** `lch` via
  `element->getCharacteristicLength()` (which already encodes `ASDShellQ4`'s EAS `/2` correction);
  treat through-thickness crush regularization as the **layer thickness handled in the material from a
  value the layer already knows**; **document that out-of-plane bending-crack energy is not
  through-thickness size-objective on the director-shell host** (that physics belongs to the solid-shell).
- **Option B (when inclined-crack mesh-objectivity is required):** add a small, **Ladruno-tagged,
  `LEDGER_vanilla_files`-recorded** edit to `LayeredShellFiberSection`/`ASDShellQ4` plumbing a
  per-direction `lch` to the layer — and **drop the "zero vanilla edit" claim** for that case.
There is **no silent `lch` default**: a mesh-objectivity test fails loudly if the scalar fallback is used
in a softening run.

**D6 — External + validation.** LS-DYNA is prior art for the architecture and a physics reference, not a
correctness proof. The validation battery (below) maps to the two-zone testbed, **corrects the SFI-MVLEM
oracle misidentification** (it is **FSAM/fixed-strut**, verified `FSAM.cpp:10-22` — *not* MCFT; it
brackets rather than confirms a rotating-angle kernel; `ConcreteMcftNonLinear`/`RAReinforcedConcretePlaneStress`
are the genuine in-code MCFT oracles), and **documents the punching blind spot** as an xfail.

### View / NDMaterial contract

- `getType()` returns `"PlateFiber"` (33014, order 5 `{exx,eyy,gxy,gyz,gxz}`), `"PlaneStress"` (33013,
  order 3), `"ThreeDimensional"` (33015).
- `getCopy(const char* type)` self-routes to the sibling view (centralized `RCHist` (de)serializer so all
  three pack identically). The shell path requires `getCopy("PlateFiber")` to return a real order-5 clone —
  `LayeredShellFiberSection` `exit(-1)`s otherwise (the hard requirement, `:175-180`).
- `LadrunoRCPlateFiber`: in-plane block via `returnMapPS`; the `sigma_33=0` condensation uses a
  **guarded, line-searched / bisection-fallback** inner Newton that **propagates a non-convergence code**
  (must not inherit `PlateFiberMaterial`'s silent `return 0`); transverse shear is a **real degrading
  local law**, not elastic `gmod`.
- `LadrunoRCFiniteStrain : public FiniteStrainNDMaterial` — `setTrialF(F)` → Hencky → kernel → Cauchy +
  spatial tangent; objective for the isotropic spine only.
- `setResponse`: `"damage"->(dt,dc)`, `"beta"`, `"betaShear"`, `"eps1"`, `"crackNormal"`,
  `"stress"`, `"strain"`, `"tangent"`, `"tauxz_profile"` (output-recovery only).

### How it rides the existing seam

`ASDShellQ4 -corotational` → `LayeredShellFiberSection` (unmodified) → per layer
`getCopy("PlateFiber")` → `LadrunoRCPlateFiber` (33014) → `returnMapPS` + transverse-shear block.
Boundary-element rebar = discrete `PlateRebar(LadrunoRebarBuckling)` layers at true bar depth; smeared web
steel is **inside** the kernel for MCFT composite `eps_1`.

---

## Implementation path

Each phase is independently shippable and reduces to baseline when its flags are off.

### Phase 1 — Compression softening on the EXISTING element/section (closes the headline gap)
- **Build:** `LadrunoRCKernel.h` + `LadrunoRCPlateFiber` (33014) with the spine cloned from
  `ASDConcrete3D`, plus `beta = 1/(0.8+170*eps_1)` **on the strength axis** (Lubliner t–c interaction
  reduced to avoid double-counting) and the consistent tangent's scalar `d beta/d eps_1` cross-term
  (fixed-projector-secant v1 for `dP`). `lch` per **D5 Option A** (scalar in-plane). Smeared web steel
  homogenized for composite `eps_1`.
- **Reuses:** `LadrunoJ2Kernel.h` pattern; `ASDConcrete3D` spine; `LayeredShellFiberSection` +
  `ASDShellQ4` unmodified (`getCopy("PlateFiber")` seam); MCFT prior-art materials as oracles;
  `PlateFiberMaterial` condensation pattern (hardened).
- **New:** the kernel, the order-5 view, the guarded `sigma_33=0` inner Newton.
- **Deliverable:** `nDMaterial LadrunoRCPlateFiber` usable in a `LayeredShellFiberSection` under
  `ASDShellQ4` with **zero element/section edit**.
- **Acceptance:** (i) closed-form `|sigma_c| = beta(eps_1)*fc'` under swept transverse tension;
  (ii) reduce-to-`ASDConcrete3D` on the raw `ThreeDimensional` path to ~1e-6/1e-7 *trajectory* tolerance
  (not byte-identity — `ASDConcrete3D` default tangent is damaged-secant, `ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp` ~1728);
  (iii) Kupfer biaxial-envelope regression (no double-counting overshoot); (iv) forward-difference tangent
  check at pre-peak, post-tensile-peak, deep-compression-softening, and a rotating-axis state;
  (v) hardened condensation: a strain history crossing the compressive peak (negative `dd22`) asserts inner
  convergence + `|sigma_33| < tol` + a propagated non-convergence code.

### Phase 2 — Degrading shear / cyclic pinching
- **Build:** fixed-crack/DSFM-slip degrading aggregate-interlock law (`-shearRetention`) + crack-closure;
  bounded by `v_ci,max`.
- **Reuses:** Phase-1 kernel; `ASDConcrete3D` crack-closure spectral reassembly.
- **New:** the interlock/slip state and its tangent cross-term.
- **Deliverable:** cyclic membrane shear law with pinching.
- **Acceptance:** cyclic shear-panel hysteresis vs an MCFT oracle and experiment — assert **pinching shape +
  cumulative hysteretic energy**, not just peak; **ablation** softening-ON/retention-OFF vs both-ON proving
  the retention term is load-bearing; **rigid-rotation objectivity** test on a cracked state (the
  stored-normal form must pass the supported corotational-element route).

#### Phase 2a (SHIPPED) — the bounded monotonic slice
Phase 2 splits into **2a** (monotonic, shipped) and **2b** (cyclic, next). 2a delivers the
**`v_ci,max` BOUND** on the membrane shear; the `{const|dsfm|rots}` retention CURVES, crack-closure,
and pinching are **2b**.
- **Flag:** ships as **`-interlock`** (with `-agg`, `-crackStrain`, `-crackSpacing`, `-lch`, `-betaSrMin`),
  default OFF ⇒ bit-identical to Phase 1. `shearRetMode` is reserved (only mode 0 wired); the ADR's
  `-shearRetention {const|dsfm|rots}` name is **deferred to 2b** (will alias/replace `-interlock` then).
- **Formulation (decided):** at first crossing of `eps_cr` the in-plane crack NORMAL is frozen. Thereafter
  the **smeared (damage-reduced) crack-plane shear** `tau_sm = m_sigma·sig_ip` is **clipped** to
  `±v_ci,max` — i.e. 2a is a *bound on the existing shear*, NOT a substitution with bare-elastic `G·gamma`
  (the bare-elastic replacement was rejected in review: it injects a stress discontinuity at cracking and a
  tangent inconsistency). Below the cap the stress is unchanged (continuous, no double-count).
- **Crack width:** `w = macauley(eps_n)·s_theta` with `eps_n` the strain **normal to the FROZEN crack**
  (this supersedes the literal `w = eps_1·s_theta` wording in §"Shear retention"; the two are equal at
  capture and `eps_n` is the fixed-crack-consistent opening thereafter). `w` grows **monotonically**
  (irreversible interlock degradation). `s_theta` = `-crackSpacing` → `lch` → 1.
- **Tangent (consistent):** sub-cap → baseline (no cross-term); capped → the rank-1 removal
  `Dtan_ip -= (1-betaSrMin)·m_eps ⊗ (m_sigma·Dtan_ip)`, exact because `m_sigma·m_eps = (c²+s²)² = 1` pins
  the crack-shear. The `v_ci,max(w)` normal→shear coupling is a deliberately-omitted 2nd-order term,
  consistent with the Phase-1 secant `W_B·C0`.
- **Verified:** Zone-A — interlock-OFF reduce-to-ASDConcrete3D on a sheared path; `v_ci,max` cap vs
  closed-form + numpy oracle; **off-axis (oblique) crack** rotation (crack normal vs analytic principal
  dir + projected crack-shear == `v_ci,max`); ON-vs-OFF ablation. Standalone g++ FD confirms the cap
  (axis + off-axis) and the tangent-pinning identity.
- **Known 2a limits (documented, deferred):** (1) **equibiaxial/degenerate** membrane states never freeze
  a crack (arbitrary principal dir) → no interlock there until the state leaves degeneracy; (2) the
  **rigid-rotation objectivity** test on a stored-normal cracked state (corot-element route) is a 2b
  acceptance item, not yet run for 2a; (3) the condensed PlateFiber/PlaneStress × interlock interaction is
  exercised only via the 3D `stdBrick` so far.

#### Phase 2b.1 (SHIPPED) — cyclic crack-shear (incremental friction-slip)
- **Flag:** `-cyclic` (a sub-flag of `-interlock`); default OFF ⇒ 2a (monotone clip) is byte-identical.
- **Model (decided):** the crack-plane shear becomes an **independent incremental friction-slip state**
  (FSAM-crib, `InterLocker_improved`): `tau_cr = clamp(tau_cr_committed + G·(gamma_nt − gamma_nt_committed),
  ±v_ci,max(w))`, `G = E/2(1+nu)`, slip origin frozen at crack capture. The crack width `w` is now
  **REVERSIBLE** (`w = macauley(eps_n)·s_theta` of the *current* opening, not the monotone max) so crack
  closure raises the cap (capacity recovery); reduces to a monotone ramp-then-cap (same `v_ci,max` plateau
  as 2a) under monotonic loading. State = 2 committed scalars `{tauCr, gammaCr}` per the FSAM minimal recipe.
- **Cap = MCFT `v_ci,max(w)`** (not Coulomb `μ·σ_n`) — keeps the 2a/ADR bound; the FSAM `μ·f_n` friction
  cap is an alternative deferred to 2b.2.
- **Diverges from FSAM in three respects** (so the "FSAM crib" credit is not misread): (1) the cap is MCFT
  `v_ci,max(w)`, not FSAM's Coulomb `μ·f_n`; (2) the slip stiffness is the FULL elastic `G = E/2(1+nu)`, not
  FSAM's `0.4·Ec`; (3) there is **no zero-shear-when-open collapse** — an open crack still transfers shear up
  to the (width-degraded) `v_ci,max(w)` rather than being forced to zero. (1) and (3) keep continuity with the
  2a bound; the FSAM variants are 2b.2 options.
- **Consistent tangent:** remove the smeared crack-shear sensitivity `m_eps⊗(m_sigma·D)` then add the
  friction stiffness `G·m_eps⊗m_eps` (full when sliding-elastic; floored to `betaSrMin·G` when capped).
  Verified: standalone FD gives `Dtan[3][3] = G` exactly on the elastic-unload branch. **At the single
  crack-CAPTURE step** the stress is seeded to the clipped smeared shear (continuity) while the tangent adds
  the friction stiffness — a deliberate one-step secant compromise (same spirit as 2a's capture), not a
  derivation error.
- **Verified (Zone-A, material-point):** reversal re-caps at ∓`v_ci,max` + energy dissipation; unload
  stiffness == `G`; crack-closure raises the cap (capacity recovery); monotonic reduces to the 2a plateau;
  C++ ≡ numpy oracle step-by-step over a full reversing path (cyclic crack-shear is backbone-independent).
- **Pinching is a PANEL phenomenon (deferred to 2b.2):** at a material point with a fixed crack and constant
  normal strain the loop is *fat* (the elastic `±v_ci/G` band is sub-step); a pinched waist needs the crack
  to open/close during the cycle (principal-direction rotation), which only happens in a real panel. The
  ADR's pinching-shape + hysteretic-energy acceptance vs a **Tran–Wallace squat-wall** experiment is 2b.2.
- **Deferred to 2b.2:** crack-closure spectral reassembly on the NORMAL direction; the `-shearRetention
  {const|dsfm|rots}` retention CURVES + cyclic interlock-surface degradation (FSAM `epsiloncmax` knockdown of
  `v_ci,max`); panel/experiment pinching validation; rigid-rotation objectivity; PlateFiber×condensation +
  serialization-round-trip cyclic tests.

#### Phase 2b.2a (SHIPPED) — shell-element integration + serialization (test-only, no kernel change)
Closes the two biggest test gaps the adversarial reviews flagged. **No code change** — proves the existing
material in its real target host.
- **Shell integration (the whole point):** `LadrunoRCConcrete` is exercised end-to-end inside
  **`ASDShellQ4` + `section LayeredShell`** (the PlateFiber view via `getCopy("PlateFiber")` + its
  guarded `σ33=0` inner Newton), which until now had only been tested on a 3D `stdBrick`. New
  `tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_shell.py` (Zone-A, no gmsh — a single flat ASDShellQ4 unit quad with every
  membrane DOF prescribed via Penalty): (1) membrane tension cracks + softens (`Nxx` peaks at `ft·h` then
  drops); (2) **cyclic membrane shear saturates `Nxy` at the MCFT bound `±v_ci,max·h` on both signs** — the
  PlateFiber × σ33-condensation × cyclic-friction path, verified in the real shell; (3) the interlock is
  load-bearing in the shell (ON caps `Nxy` below OFF).
- **Serialization round-trip:** a Zone-A test drives an oblique cracked cyclic state, `save`/`restore`s it
  through the FE database (`sendSelf`/`recvSelf`), and asserts the crack frame + width + `{tauCr,gammaCr}`
  survive bit-exactly (guards the `RC_DATA=242` field count/order).
- **Still deferred to 2b.2b:** crack-closure normal spectral reassembly; `-shearRetention` retention CURVES +
  cyclic interlock-surface degradation; **panel/experiment pinching validation (Tran–Wallace)** — the one
  that needs a meshed non-homogeneous wall where principal rotation produces the pinched waist; rigid-rotation
  objectivity; serialization schema-version field.

#### Phase 2b.2b (SHIPPED) — second orthogonal crack (X-cracking) + cyclic interlock-surface wear
Designed via a 3-formulation design→critique workflow. The workflow's two-state-SUM design was found to
**double-count** (net membrane shear `≈ τ_ci1 − τ_ci2 − τ_sm1` → `≈2·v_ci,max` when both cracks equally
engaged) and to need a first-order reversal tangent; the **shipped design is a corrected single-friction-
state + governing-cap** variant that delivers the same physics without those flaws.
- **Flag:** `-xcrack` (implies `-cyclic`⇒`-interlock`); default OFF ⇒ 2b.1 byte-identical. Knobs
  `-degKappa`/`-degSlipRef`/`-degMin`.
- **Second crack:** an orthogonal crack 2, normal `(−s,c)`, freezes when the strain normal to THAT plane
  reaches `eps_cr` (FSAM `CepsA2≥eunpA2` + orthogonality lock). The interlock cap then uses the **GOVERNING
  (most-open) crack's opening** `v_ci,max(macauley(max(en1,en2))·s_θ)` — so the REVERSE shear direction is
  also capped (2a/2b.1 single crack only capped the crack-1 direction). No double-count: ONE friction state,
  ONE governing cap.
- **Cyclic wear:** an irreversible Archard-style knockdown `kn = max(degMin, 1 − degKappa·clamp(slipCum/
  degSlipRef,0,1))` driven by the **cumulative crack sliding distance** `slipCum` (not peak slip, which
  saturates in cycle 1 under constant amplitude). Driven by the COMMITTED `slipCum` ⇒ tangent-neutral, so the
  benign 2b.1 tangent is unchanged. This produces gradual cyclic strength decay (verified: +caps `2.90→2.50→
  2.10` over 3 cycles) — and, with the friction unload, the low-cap reversal waist (the pinch driver).
- **Serialization** grows a hard-checked **schema-version field** (`RC_SCHEMA_VERSION`, rejects mismatched
  vectors) + `{cracked2, slipCum}` (+2 doubles) + 4 Params. New `xcrackState` response.
- **Verified (Zone-A, material-point):** reduce-to-2b.1 (xcrack + `degKappa 0` on a no-crack-2 path = bit-
  identical); crack 2 captures under biaxial (not uniaxial) tension; **cyclic strength degrades monotonically**
  over cycles (constant-amplitude) vs constant no-wear cap; C++ ≡ numpy oracle step-by-step with wear engaged.
- **PINCHING shape is still a panel effect** (2b.2c, below): under proportional homogeneous shear the crack
  sits on the principal plane (`g_nt=0`, interlock inert); X-cracking + wear give bidirectional capping +
  strength decay at the material point, but the pinched *waist* needs a meshed wall (principal rotation).
- **Coverage note (review):** the `en_gov = max(en1,en2)` *crack-2-governs* branch is verified analytically
  (2 design-review agents re-derived it) but is NOT hit by a homogeneous material-point test — exercising it
  needs crack 2 to FORM (biaxial) AND GOVERN (`en2>en1`, `en1<0`) with shear on a crack plane, i.e. a
  non-proportional biaxial path. That regime is exercised naturally by the 2b.2c meshed panel (rotating
  principals + both cracks); a dedicated homogeneous off-axis test is deferred there.
- **Still deferred to 2b.2c:** crack-closure normal spectral reassembly; the `-shearRetention {const|dsfm|
  rots}` retention CURVES; **panel/experiment pinching validation (Tran–Wallace)**; rigid-rotation objectivity.

#### Phase 2b.2c.1 (SHIPPED) — `-shearRetention {mcft|const|dsfm|rots}` crack-shear retention curves
Wires the long-reserved `shearRetMode` (the parser had a `NOTE` placeholder, only mode 0 live) into a real
flag selecting the **CYCLIC crack-plane slip stiffness** `G_slip` in the friction predictor
`τ_cr = clamp(τ_cr_c + G_slip·Δγ_nt, ±v_ci,max(w))`. The `v_ci,max(w)` **cap is unchanged in every mode**
(keeps the 2a/ADR bound) — only the slip stiffness changes. All modes reduce to `mcft`.
- **Flag:** `-shearRetention {mcft|const|dsfm|rots}` (+ `-shearRetFactor $mu` for `const`). Default = `mcft`.
  `const`/`dsfm` imply `-interlock -cyclic`; `rots` implies `-interlock`. mcft (the shipped default) implies
  nothing ⇒ **2b.2b byte-identical when the flag is absent**.
- **Modes (decided):**
  - `mcft` (0, default): `G_slip = G = E/2(1+ν)` — the shipped full-elastic slip stiffness (DSFM-with-slip).
  - `const` (1): `G_slip = μ·G`, `μ = -shearRetFactor` ∈ (0,1] (default 0.4, the FSAM `0.4·Ec` lineage) —
    classic constant shear retention (Rots/Červenka). `μ=1` ⇒ bit-identical to `mcft`.
  - `dsfm` (2): `G_slip = G·(0.31/denom)`, `denom = 0.31 + 24w/(a_g+16)` — DSFM-flavored **width-degraded**
    slip stiffness (softens as the crack opens). At `w=0` ⇒ `mcft`.
  - `rots` (3): rotating-coaxial — the fixed-crack shear block is **skipped entirely** (no capture, no clip,
    no friction, no tangent cross-term), so the membrane shear stays smeared/spectral ⇒ **identical to
    `-interlock` OFF**. The ADR's monotonic-only rotating choice, surfaced so a user can A/B vs fixed-crack.
- **Scope honesty:** `const`/`dsfm` parametrize the *slip stiffness*, which only exists on the `-cyclic`
  friction path; on the 2a monotone-clip path they are inert (same `v_ci,max` plateau). Documented, not silent.
- **Serialization:** `RC_SCHEMA_VERSION 2→3` (+`shearRetFactor`, hard-checked; rejects v2 vectors).
- **Verified (Zone-A, material-point + numpy oracle):** `const(μ=1)` ≡ `mcft` (max |Δτ| < 1e-9); `const`
  unload slope == `μ·G`; `dsfm` unload slope == `G·0.31/denom` (closed-form, wide-crack); cap still
  `±v_ci,max` in every mode; `rots` ≡ interlock-OFF (no crack frozen); C++ ≡ numpy oracle step-by-step on a
  reversing `const` path. 25/25 material + 35/35 full RC suite green; no regression to 2a/2b.1/2b.2b.
- **Still deferred to 2b.2c.2+:** crack-closure normal spectral reassembly; **panel/experiment pinching
  validation (Tran–Wallace)**; rigid-rotation objectivity.

#### Phase 2b.2c.2 (SHIPPED, test-only) — rigid-rotation objectivity gate
The keystone acceptance test deferred since 2a/2b.1/2b.2a/2b.2b. The fixed-crack design rests on the
claim (ADR D1/D5) that the supported large-rotation route — the **corotational element**
(`ASDShellQ4 -corotational`), which feeds the small-strain material the *de-rotated* strain `Q^T E Q` —
is objective for the **directional** crack/interlock state. The property that makes that route objective
is the constitutive frame-indifference identity
`σ(Q E Q^T) == Q σ(E) Q^T` over an arbitrary cracked, cyclic, X-cracked history.
- **Test:** `tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_objectivity.py` (Zone-A). The homogeneous all-DOF-prescribed
  (Penalty) `stdBrick` probe is driven through a tension-then-reversing-shear path that forms a fixed
  crack and exercises the interlock, in the reference frame AND in a frame rigidly rotated about z by a
  **large** angle (parametrized 30°/90°/127°, plus 63° with `-xcrack` + wear), prescribing the full
  symmetric strain tensor `u = E·X` from the rotated basis tensors `Q A Q^T`, `Q B Q^T`. Asserts the two
  stress trajectories coincide after the Q-transform to `< 1e-5·peak`.
- **Result: PASS (4/4), no kernel change.** The cracked directional state is objective **by construction**
  — the crack normal is captured from the strain principal direction (co-rotates with the frame), the
  interlock projectors `m_ε`/`m_σ` are built from that normal (co-rotate), and the friction predictor /
  `v_ci,max` cap / wear are built from *frame-invariant scalars* (`g_nt`, `e_n`, `slipCum`). So rotating
  the strain frame rotates the stress frame identically. This **discharges the ADR's Zone-A objectivity
  item (a)** (corotational-element route → PASS) at the constitutive level; the §14.11 `setTrialF`
  material-view xfail (item b) is unchanged (that path is Phase 4).
- **Still deferred to 2b.2c.3+:** crack-closure normal spectral reassembly; **panel/experiment pinching
  validation (Tran–Wallace squat-wall, meshed)**.

#### Phase 2b.2c.3 (RESOLVED by verification, test-only) — crack-closure on the NORMAL direction
The deferred "crack-closure normal spectral reassembly" turns out to be **already correct in the cloned
spine** — the right engineering conclusion, not a new feature. `ASDConcrete3D`'s `StressDecomposition`
recomputes the spectral tension/compression split **every step** from the live effective stress with
**independent `dt`/`dc`** and `cdf=0`; that per-step recompose **is** unilateral crack closure on the
normal direction (tensile damage `dt` does not bleed into the compressive cone, so a closing crack
recovers full compressive stiffness). The kernel clones this verbatim. The **fixed-crack** addition
(2a/2b) is therefore correctly **shear-only** — it modifies only the crack-plane shear `m_σ·σ_ip`, never
the normal stress, which remains the spine's spectral job. There is no separate fixed-crack normal
reassembly to add at the constitutive level; adding one would double-count the spine's recompose.
- **Verified (Zone-A, `tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_material.py`):** (i) crack a point in tension
  (`dt>0`, stress softens) then load past the compressive peak ⇒ the compression capacity **fully
  recovers** (== a virgin compression run, prior tensile damage does not knock it down); (ii) crack →
  close → **reopen** ⇒ the reopened tension follows the **damaged** envelope (≪ virgin elastic), so
  tensile damage is irreversible even though compression recovered; (iii) the same full-compression
  recovery holds with the **fixed-crack interlock ON** (freezing the crack normal does not corrupt the
  normal closure). 4/4 new gates; full RC suite 42/42.
- **Caveat (honest):** this verifies the **rotating/spectral** closure (the spine's frame), which the
  objectivity gate (2b.2c.2) showed is frame-indifferent. A *directional* fixed-crack normal
  traction–separation law (distinct from the spine's spectral normal) is **not** part of this model and
  is not needed for the membrane-shear physics; if a future phase wants an explicit fixed-crack normal
  opening law it is a separate, deliberate addition (noted, not silently assumed done).

#### Phase 2b.2c.4 (HARNESS built, validation deferred) — Tran–Wallace squat-wall pinching
The one remaining 2b.2c item: a meshed non-homogeneous wall where principal rotation produces the pinched
*waist* the material-point tests structurally cannot. Material physics for cyclic is now **complete**
(compression softening, interlock bound, cyclic friction-slip, X-cracking + wear, retention curves,
IMPL-EX robustness, objectivity, crack closure); this is a **validation**, not new physics.
- **Harness built (`tests/_testbed/rc_wall_harness.py`, not a pytest gate):** a structured `NX×NY`
  ASDShellQ4 grid on a `LayeredShell` = 4 `LadrunoRCConcrete` concrete layers (full cyclic stack
  `-beta -lublinerReduced -interlock -cyclic -implex`) + 2 smeared `PlateRebar(Steel02)` web-steel layers
  (no gmsh — environment-portable). **Status (run on this branch):** the model assembles, runs, and
  produces a real cyclic shear response **with hysteretic dissipation** on the first drift cycle
  (`V≈±146 kN` at 0.3 mm; closed-loop area > 0), then **walls on convergence at larger drift (~0.6 mm+)**
  — the classic cyclic-softening RC-wall barrier.
- **Deferred (the research-grade validation):** (1) a robust multi-cycle solver — arc-length /
  `LadrunoIndirectControl` follower (built for exactly this snap-back), dynamic relaxation, finer
  substeps, or an IMPL-EX-error step-cut — to push to the drifts where the waist is pronounced;
  (2) calibration to a named specimen (**Tran–Wallace RW-A20-P10** or a PEER squat-wall) asserting
  **pinching shape + cumulative hysteretic energy** vs the measured loops (the ADR's primary squat-wall
  gate); (3) optional gmsh/apeGmsh graded mesh + boundary elements (then `zone_b`). This is the genuine
  Zone-B validation the ADR always framed it as, not a clean material slice.

##### Phase 2b.2c.4a (SHIPPED) — deferred item (1) RESOLVED via quasi-static EXPLICIT
Item (1) — the robust multi-cycle solver — is solved by the **right tool, not a heavier implicit one**.
The fork's monotonic solvers (`LadrunoArcLength`, `LadrunoIndirectControl`, `LadrunoDynamicRelaxation`,
the `robust_drive` rung ladder) all trace ONE equilibrium path through a limit point — a load **reversal**
is not a single monotonic path, so none of them naturally do cyclic. The cyclic tool is **quasi-static
EXPLICIT** (`CentralDifferenceLadruno`): it forms NO stiffness tangent, so the indefinite-softening-tangent
stall that wals the implicit harness at ~0.6 mm **does not exist** — reversals + softening integrate through.
- **Result:** a gmsh-meshed 4×3 squat wall (aspect H/L=0.75, `-beta -interlock -cyclic -xcrack`) **completes
  the full ±8 mm reversing drift schedule** under `CentralDifferenceLadruno` (15000 steps, ~1.8 MN peak,
  physical). The single-element panel completes too. **The implicit barrier is gone.**
- **Panel-scale ablation (the load-bearing proof):** with the cyclic friction-slip + X-crack wear ON the
  wall dissipates **~28 % LESS hysteretic energy** and reaches **~11 % lower peak shear** than the monotone
  `-interlock` bound (which cannot degrade across reversals). At single-element scale this is invisible
  (concrete-damage-dominated); at the mesh scale principal rotation engages the interlock and it is a clear
  margin. Tests: `tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_wall.py` (Zone-B, gmsh): (i) explicit completes the cyclic
  softening history; (ii) cyclic degradation is load-bearing (energy + peak vs monotone).
- **Explicit recipe / gotchas (in [[LEDGER_quirks]]):** element mass via material `-rho` (nodal mass leaves
  the eigensolve with no M); **ASDShellQ4 supplies no per-element `dt_cr`** (`criticalTimeStep()`=-1) ⇒
  manual wave-speed bound `dt≈0.2·h/√(E/ρ)`; no `equalDOF` (stability ignores constraints — prescribe the
  rigid-top drift via per-node `sp`); mass-proportional damping only (`betaK` collapses `dt_cr`); quasi-static
  = loading period ≫ structure period (cosine drift on a dt grid).
- **Still deferred (items 2–3):** quantitative **Tran–Wallace RW-A20-P10** calibration (specimen geometry +
  smeared/boundary reinforcement + measured-loop pinching-shape & cumulative-energy assertions) and the
  optional graded gmsh/boundary-element mesh. The SOLVER is no longer the blocker; what remains is the
  experiment match.

### Phase 3 — Tension stiffening + crack-band/`lch` hardening

#### Phase 3a (SHIPPED) — VC/CM tension stiffening
- **Built:** `-tensStiff {vc|cm}` (+`-tensStiffC c`, `-tensStiffAlpha a`), default OFF ⇒ baseline-identical.
  A rank-1 stress FLOOR on the LIVE in-plane principal tensile axis `p1`: inject `Δ=σ_ts(ε1)−n^Tσn` along
  `p1` (only when `Δ>0`), active ONLY post-crack (`ε1≥ε_cr`). `σ_ts=ft/(1+√(c·ε1))` (vc/Bentz) or
  `α·ft/(1+√(500·ε1))` (cm/Collins–Mitchell); `ε1`=the COMPOSITE membrane principal tensile strain (same
  one the MCFT `β` uses). Equibiaxial (degenerate `p1`) floors BOTH in-plane normals (self-consistency
  `ts_meas·ts_inj=1`). Consistent tangent (`dσ_ts/dε1` + the full-6-column `−d(n^Tσn)/dε` pinning, `dp1/dε`
  omitted like the `β` tangent; dropped under IMPL-EX). `ftPeak` cached + serialized; **schema v3→v4**.
- **Scope (v1):** MONOTONIC backbone floor — `σ_ts(live ε1)` re-inflates on unload (no `ε1max` memory);
  combined TS+interlock validated for proportional (non-rotating) loading. Cyclic upgrade
  (`ε1max`-envelope + secant unload + frozen-plane TS) deferred.
- **Gates:** numpy oracle T1 (uniaxial closed-form `σ_xx==σ_ts(ε1)`) + standalone g++ (floor +
  equibiaxial-both-normals to 1e-16 + FD tangent on the pinned direction) + OpenSees Zone-A 11/11
  (`tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_tensstiff.py`, incl. PlateFiber-shell `Nxx==σ_ts·h` + schema-v4
  round-trip). Hardened via a 3-agent adversarial review (degen 2× under-delivery fix; `c>0` guard;
  PlateFiber/interlock/cm/unload coverage). **Zero vanilla edit (Option A retained).**

#### Phase 3b (SHIPPED, structural gate staged) — crack-band/`lch` resolution
- **Built:** `-autoRegularization $lch_ref` (default OFF ⇒ baseline-identical) — a faithful clone of
  `ASDConcrete3D`'s opt-in Bažant–Oh regularization: `fractureEnergy` + `regularize` (+ the `adjust`
  re-enforcement) in `LadrunoRCKernel.h`; latch `lch = ops_TheActiveElement->getCharacteristicLength()`
  (EAS-aware) or `-lch` **once** at first `setTrialStrain`; rescale the softening so `g_reg =
  G_f0·(lch_ref/lch)` ⇒ `g_reg·lch` mesh-objective. **D5 Option A** retained (scalar in-plane `lch`,
  zero vanilla edit). **LOUD FAILURE** (no silent fallback) if `autoReg` on but no `lch` resolvable.
  schema v4→v5. `getCopy` propagates the latch; loud-fail does **not** latch (so a step-retry can't
  silently proceed un-regularized).
- **Gates:** numpy oracle R1 (`g_reg·lch` constant across `lch`) + standalone g++ `rc_reg_gpp.cpp`
  (energy-objectivity + `lch==lch_ref` no-op + steep-damage plastic-strain monotonicity) + CI wrapper
  + Zone-A 5/5 (`tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_reg.py`: energy×`lch` objectivity across `lch=50/25/12.5`,
  no-op reduce, element-`lch` path, parser guard, schema-v5 serialization round-trip). Hardened via a
  3-agent adversarial review (the missing `adjust()` re-enforcement, the `getCopy` double-regularize
  latch, and the loud-fail self-latch were all caught + fixed).
- **Staged:** the **structural** in-plane mesh-objectivity gate on an **inclined-crack (rotated) /
  notched panel** (localization study; peak ~1–3%, energy ~3–5% across 2× refine) — the regularization
  MECHANISM is proven at the material point (energy×`lch` const); the localized-band structural proof
  (snap-back-prone, needs a careful softening solver) is the remaining acceptance item.

### Phase 4 — Finite-strain view + IMPL-EX

#### Phase 4a (SHIPPED) — IMPL-EX on the small-strain material (pulled forward)
IMPL-EX was pulled ahead of the finite-strain view because the **Phase-2b.2c cyclic-wall
validation is blocked on it**: a meshed squat panel under axial + cyclic shear will not
converge with vanilla Newton (the implicit consistent tangent goes indefinite on the
softening branch), and `LadrunoRCConcrete` had no IMPL-EX while `ASDConcrete3D` does — this
was empirically falsified on a single-element ASDShellQ4 panel before implementing.
- **Flag:** `-implex` [`-implexAlpha a`] [`-implexControl tol redLim`], default OFF ⇒
  fully-implicit, byte-identical. No new classTag.
- **Scheme (mirrors `ASDConcrete3DMaterial::compute(do_implex,…)`):** `setTrialStrain` runs
  the EXPLICIT pass — damage thresholds `xt,xc` and MCFT `β` from `x_ext = x_n + tf·(x_n −
  x_{n-1})`, frozen over the step ⇒ secant tangent, no softening-rate/no β cross-term.
  `commitState` re-integrates IMPLICITLY at the converged strain to advance the TRUE
  thresholds, measure `implexError`, and roll n→n-1. RCHist += `{xt_old,xc_old,eps1_old}`;
  serialization schema **v1→v2** (RC_DATA 242→262, hard-checked); `implexError` response.
- **Static-analysis guard (real gotcha, in [[LEDGER_quirks]]):** `implexTimeFactor()` clamps
  the load-factor-pseudo-time `ops_Dt` ratio (erratic + resets at `loadConst`) — fall back to
  `α`, clamp to `2α` — else the extrapolation detonates on the first static step.
- **Honest scope:** the DAMAGE is frozen (the robustness that matters); the spectral
  projectors PT/PC are NOT frozen (consistent with the material's fixed-projector-secant
  philosophy — the implicit tangent omits `∂P/∂ε` too). Full `PT_commit` freeze for a
  strain-constant tangent under rotating principals is a scoped follow-up.
- **Verified:** Zone-A 6/6 (`tests/test_ladrunoRCConcrete_implex.py`): off-identical, tracks
  implicit on a smooth path, error active on rate change / zero while elastic, SPD secant
  under softening, `-numericalTangent` bypassed under implex, save/restore continuation.
  3-agent adversarial review (0 state-machine/serialization bugs; fixed the FD-tangent
  bypass and a header overclaim).

#### Phase 4b (SHIPPED 2026-06-18, classTag **33018**) — finite-strain view
- **Built:** `LadrunoRCFiniteStrain` as a **native `FiniteStrainNDMaterial` subclass** (NOT the generic
  `LogStrain` wrapper — that recovers the committed `bᵉ` via the inner *initial* tangent, which a
  stiffness-degrading damage inner shrinks by `(1−d)`; see `LEDGER_quirks`). The RC spine carries no
  tensorial plastic strain ⇒ the elastic left Cauchy–Green is the **total `B=F Fᵀ`** recomputed each
  step (no `bᵉ` to track). Seam: `B → εᵉ=½ln B → returnMap3D → σ=τ/J + c=(1/2J)[D:L:B]`
  (`LogStrainKernel.h`). All RC flags + **IMPL-EX** ride the shared kernel unchanged. classTag 33018
  (the ADR's earlier "33015" was the small-strain class — a separate broker class needs its own tag).
- **Reused:** `FiniteStrainNDMaterial`, `LogStrainKernel.h`, `LadrunoRCKernel.h`; the `LadrunoJ2Finite` pattern.
- **Acceptance (Zone-A 9/9, `tests/test_ladrunoRCFiniteStrain.py`):** reduce-to-small-strain; the headline
  stress-seam cross-check `σ == (small-strain RC at ½ln B)/J`; ELASTIC tangent `K==FD` (the damage
  tangent is a deliberate secant ⇒ the FD gate stays elastic); isotropic-spine objectivity `σ(QF)==Qσ(F)Qᵀ`
  at two rotation magnitudes; IMPL-EX tracks implicit; det F≤0 guard; DB round-trip. The
  **directional** large-rotation **xfail** (§14.11, fixed-crack/interlock state not co-rotated by the
  material view) is the documented boundary; it was NOT wired as an element-solver test (a
  committed-crack-then-large-rotation static solve fights the softening interlock tangent — the same
  reason the cyclic wall is quasi-static explicit). A co-rotating-crack finite-native view (the RC
  analog of `LadrunoJ2Finite`'s channel-B) to flip the xfail is deferred.

### Phase 5 — `LadrunoSolidShell` (33020) — optional through-thickness host
- **Build:** 8-node, 3-DOF, **genuine state-dependent EAS-on-`E33`** (persistent `alpha`, per-Newton
  consistent-damaged-tangent condensation, serialized) + ANS/MITC transverse shear + ANS membrane;
  selectable multi-layer/Gauss–Lobatto `n_z`; directional/projected `lch`; `cond(S)` corot guard.
- **Reuses:** `SolidTransformation` linear/corot/finite; `LadrunoRCFiniteStrain`; `LadrunoBrick` damage-
  scaled `Kstab` (as stabilization, re-tuned for thin shells, **not** as the EAS template).
- **Deliverable:** punching/bearing/3D-stress RC host with `sigma_33`.
- **Acceptance:** elastic patch + pinched-cylinder + Scordelis-Lo (element correctness) **and** a
  **softening snap-back** (mesh-objective dissipation, Newton/arc-length convergence with the
  incomplete-geometric + secant tangent), a slab **punching** benchmark, and an EAS internal-mode
  growth-stability check under post-peak softening.

---

## Validation plan (mapped to the two-zone testbed)

**Zone-A (upstreamable pytest):**
1. Membrane/bending/shear constant-stress **patch** tests through `ASDShellQ4` + view (elastic) → ~1e-8.
2. **Objectivity, split:** (a) pure rigid rotation via the corotational **element** path → must PASS;
   (b) superposed finite-rotation + deviatoric strain via the FiniteStrain **material** view → **xfail**
   (§14.11 directional-state mechanism).
3. **reduce-to-`ASDConcrete3D`** identity gate (flags off) on the **raw `ThreeDimensional`** view, stress
   *trajectory* ~1e-6/1e-7 (bypasses condensation; floor set by damaged-secant tangent + condensation
   residual).
4. **`beta` strength oracle** — closed-form `|sigma_c| = beta(eps_1)*fc'`.
5. **Forward-difference tangent** at pre-peak / post-tensile-peak / deep-compression / rotating-axis /
   **equibiaxial** (finite, symmetric — guards the eigenprojector regularization).
6. **Condensation robustness** — `PlateFiber`/`PlaneStress` `sigma_33=0` Newton across the compressive
   peak (negative `dd22`): inner convergence + residual + non-convergence code (the most likely hidden
   source of false global non-convergence).
7. **IMPL-EX vs implicit** `O(dt)` on a smooth proportional path; **Kupfer** biaxial-envelope no-overshoot.

**Zone-B (gmsh, fork-local):**
8. **Squat shear wall** (aspect <~1.5), cyclic — vs **FSAM-backed SFI-MVLEM as a fixed-angle bracket** and
   an **MCFT in-code oracle** (`ConcreteMcftNonLinear`/`RAReinforcedConcretePlaneStress`), with a named
   **physical experiment** (e.g. Tran–Wallace RW-A20-P10 or a PEER specimen) as the **primary** gate —
   asserting diagonal-strut capacity **and** pinching shape + hysteretic energy.
9. **Slender flexural wall** (aspect >~2) — fiber flexural backbone + boundary-element rebar buckling via
   `PlateRebar(LadrunoRebarBuckling)`.
10. **Two-way slab nonlinear bending** vs yield-line/experiment.
11. **In-plane mesh-objectivity** on a **rotated (inclined-crack)** notched panel + the chosen `lch`
    resolution; loud failure on scalar fallback in softening.
12. **Punching-shear blind-spot — xfail with a written mechanism note + `LEDGER_quirks` entry:** a
    director/condensed-`PlaneStress` shell carries constant transverse shear and no `sigma_33` and
    **cannot form a punching cone**; refinement cannot manufacture the missing kinematics. The documented
    resolution is `LadrunoSolidShell` (Phase 5).
13. *(Optional)* `tauxz_profile` **output recovery** vs the LS-DYNA §11 reconstruction (recorder only).

## Risks & open questions

> [!question] **(FATAL→mitigated) `beta` insertion point — strength axis, not strain abscissa.**
> Scaling the `equivalentCompressiveStrainMeasure` abscissa does not realize `fc_eff = beta*fc'` on a

> [!question] **(HIGH) The shell path is `PlateFiber`-only.** `ASDShellQ4` consumes a section, not an

> [!question] **(HIGH→narrowed) Solid-shell corotation + single-layer flexure.** The single nodal-cloud
> `R` is ill-conditioned for thin shells (`cond(S) ~ (L/t)^2`) and 2 z-Gauss points cannot resolve

> [!question] **(MEDIUM) "Byte-identical across views" is downgraded.** A directional law's native PS map
> and 3D map do not commute with condensation/log-strain. The guarantee is `returnMapPS` shared between
> the `PlaneStress` view and the `PlateFiber` in-plane block; the FiniteStrain view is validated

**Nonlocal / E-FEM boundary.** A **local** crack-band RC kernel composes for free into the existing seam.
**Nonlocal / gradient-damage** regularization needs neighbor-state averaging or an extra nodal Helmholtz
field — OpenSees has no general nonlocal section/element machinery, no integration-point neighbor map at the
section level, and no extra-DOF gradient field on shells. The **E-FEM** embedded-discontinuity path (ADR #18)
needs condensed internal DOF + an enriched section/element. Both are **out of scope** for this material-only
stack and belong to a future section/element ADR; the RC kernel does not pretend to deliver them.

**Objectivity caveat (restated).** Scalar `dt`/`dc` are frame-indifferent; the stored crack frame and
interlock direction are directional internal variables bounded by dSNPO §14.11 under large rotation. The
corotational **element** path is the supported objective route; the FiniteStrain material view is xfail for
the combined large-rotation + directional-state case until a co-rotating-crack finite-native view is built.

**Provenance note.** `FiniteStrainNDMaterial.h`, `LogStrainNDMaterial.{h,cpp}`, `LadrunoJ2Kernel.h`, the
`reinforcedConcretePlaneStress/` family, `ConcreteMcftNonLinear5/7`, and `FSAM.{h,cpp}` are all verified
present on this branch. The LS-DYNA Vol II per-`MAT` page numbers are **not yet spot-checked** and must be
verified or reduced to `MAT`-number citations before the ADR is finalized.

## Design discussion log

| Dim | Decision | Strongest adversarial finding (severity) | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** Hosts | Reuse `ASDShellQ4`; build `LadrunoSolidShell` (33020) as a punching/bearing specialist | `LadrunoBrick` EAS is constant initial-tangent SSP, not a softening-EAS template (**fatal**) | Strike the reuse claim; spec genuine state-dependent Simo–Rifai EAS-on-`E33` as net-new; demote solid-shell from co-equal flexural host to 3D-stress specialist with selectable `n_z` |
| **D2** Seam | 8-vec generalized strain → section → 5-comp `PlateFiber`; `F` is a separate optional host | Directional `lch` cannot ride the unchanged seam; `F`-asset files unverified (**high/medium**) | Files verified present; lead with the first-principles Belytschko split; resolve `lch` via D5 Option A/B (drop "zero edit" if Option B) |
| **D3** Section | `LayeredShellFiberSection` as-is via `PlateFiber`; midpoint, 8–12 layers | A subclass not overriding `getCopy()` is **sliced** to vanilla on per-GP clone (**fatal**) | v1 needs no fork section (view drops into the unmodified section); if subclassed, full `MovableObject` contract; rebar as own thin layer; `setResponse('damage')` = recorder only; floor `lch_t` |
| **D4** Kernel | Spine + strength-axis `beta` + fixed-crack interlock + re-derived tangent + clamped IMPL-EX | `beta` wired to the strain **abscissa**, not the strength axis — does not realize `fc_eff=beta*fc'` (**fatal**) | Apply `beta` to the strength/stress axis with a closed-form acceptance test; reduce Lubliner t–c interaction to avoid double-counting; regularize the eigenprojector derivative |
| **D5** Software | Header-only kernel + 3 views (33013/33014/33015); shell path = `PlateFiber` | "`PlaneStress` drops into `ASDShellQ4`" is false (section, not `nDMaterial`); RC physics already exists in OpenSees (**high**) | Shell path is `PlateFiber`-only; `PlaneStress` = 2D/oracle; add a prior-art section + use those materials as oracles; downgrade "byte-identical across all views"; centralize `RCHist` serialization |
| **D6** External + validation | LS-DYNA = architecture prior art; 10-class battery; punching xfail | **SFI-MVLEM is FSAM (fixed-strut), not MCFT** — breaks the squat-wall isolation logic (**high**) | Correct the oracle: FSAM brackets, MCFT in-code materials confirm, experiment is primary; demote reduce-to-baseline from bit-identity to trajectory tolerance; add cyclic-energy/condensation/equibiaxial/objectivity gates; rescope §11 reconstruction to output-recovery |

**OpenSees source (verified this session, paths relative to `SRC/`)**
- `element/shell/ASDShellQ4.{h,cpp}` — `:128`/`:740` consumes a `SectionForceDeformation`;
  `:1858-1868` `getCharacteristicLength` (min-distance, EAS `/2`); `:2009` `setTrialSectionDeformation`.
- `material/section/LayeredShellFiberSection.cpp` — `:175-180` hard `getCopy("PlateFiber")` + `exit(-1)`;
  `:222` base-type `getCopy()`; `:420-504` 8→5 map + resultant integration; `:508-670` 8×8 tangent.
- `material/nD/PlateFiberMaterial.cpp` — `:213-258` `sigma_33=0` nested Newton (`return 0` even unconverged).
- `material/nD/ASDConcrete3DMaterial.cpp` — spectral split + Lubliner envelope (~2452-2497); secant tangent
  (2462-2469); IMPL-EX (2383-2398, default off ~402); `lch` latch (1614-1618); `regularize`/`gmin` (947-990).
- `material/nD/FiniteStrainNDMaterial.h`, `material/nD/LogStrainNDMaterial.{h,cpp}` — `setTrialF` / Hencky
  seam (present on branch).
- `material/nD/LadrunoJ2Kernel.h` — header-only "one core, many views" template.
- `material/nD/FSAM.{h,cpp}` — **Fixed-Strut-Angle-Model** backing SFI-MVLEM (`:10-22`).
- `material/nD/reinforcedConcretePlaneStress/` (`RA`/`FA`ReinforcedConcretePlaneStress, `ConcreteL01/Z01`,
  `SteelZ01`) and `material/nD/ConcreteMcftNonLinear5/7.{h,cpp}` — in-code MCFT prior art / oracles.
- `element/LadrunoBrick.{h,cpp}` — `:270-281` constant initial-tangent SSP `Kstab` (the non-template);
  damage-scaled `Kstab <- max(1%,1−max(dt,dc))`.
